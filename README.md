# CFD-Flow-around-Obstacle
Development of a CFD code to model flow (compressible fluid) around an obstacle employing numerical methods. The code utilizes the Runge-Kutta 2 method and the finite volume method for accurate and efficient simulations.

To visualize the results of the simulations, we can plot the gradient of the flow field. Here is an example of the gradient plot:
